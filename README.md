# insar_processing_via_pyrosar-gamma-api
InSAR processing of TanDEM-X bistatic SAR data, via extensive framework from Uni-JENA, Lehrstuhl für Fernerkundung - PyroSAR - GAMMA-API. It utilizes the extensive software GAMMA(c) for InSAR processing of SAR data.

This script was elaborated by me (Zlatomir Dimitrov, from Space Research and Technology Institute, section - Remote Sensing and GIS, at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences), in the framework of ERASMUS+ progrmme exchange at the Friedrich-Schiller-Universität JENA, Lehrstuhl für Fernerkundung, Tutor - PD Dr. Christian Thiel, in the period November - Dezember 2019. Development was kindly supported by my colleague and friend - John Truckenbrodt who showed me how deep is the rabbit hole of satellite data processing via Python, and helped me a lot with his kind advices. 
This script utilizes the extensive InSAR processing software of - GAMMA(c) - https://www.gamma-rs.ch/.
This script is based on the extensive Python based framework of PyroSAR, and embedded GAMMA-API - https://pyrosar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Only MODULE is uploaded, which contains most of the functions called from the main Python script. Thus, this Module is mostly useful for using of professionalists in InSAR processing, who willing to include it, or develop their own Python script by using PyroSAR GAMMA-API.

Please, share and redistribute with kind regards from me.
